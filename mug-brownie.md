I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

My grandgrandmother told about this recipe to my grandmother. Grandmother told my mother about this recipe. And now my mother told me about it to me.
